Workflow-Ground
==============

A very simple workflow using git.

It is composed by the following steps:

  
    1. New  repos(at gitHub).
    2. I changed the readme (at github).
    3. Committed it (at github).
    4. From my desktop computer forked the repos.
    5. I made same changes at readme.md.
    6. "git add" for the changes.
    7. "git commit" for commit the changes in the staging area.
    8. "git push" to change the repos at GitHub.
